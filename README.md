# Merge Sort Algorithm

## Project Aims
To continue with my introduction to working with Java and sorting algorithms. This was the second preliminary project to the SortManager project (https://github.com/sgrill1/SortManager).  

## How It Works
The merge sort is a 'Divide and Conquer' algorithm. It divides input array in two halves, recursively calling itself for the two halves until the arrays are length 1. It then merges the two sorted halves using the merge method.
